# Autograder

Manually correcting student submissions and entering marks in a spreadsheet might seem cumbersome (and it is!), especially when the entire process can be automated. Even for tasks involving answering theoretical questions, redundant steps like fetching and opening students' reports and accumulating entered marks in a CSV can be mechanized. These simple scripts do exactly that.
Although they were written keeping in mind submissions via Moodle, it should be easy to extend them to support any platform.
